It ends in the creation of a few temporary files that are then used to test the source decomposition methods. In the second part of the notebook we test the source decomposition methods in the data we just created, beginning with some preprocessing steps that bring the \"raw\" synthetic data to a suitable format for the method's inputs."

EEG data represents electrical activity collected from the 32-channel actiCAP arrangement. fNIRS data was recorded by two NIRSport2 devices (NIRx GmbH, Berlin, Germany) at 12.6 Hz sampling rate. EEG data was collected using a 32-channel LiveAmp amplifier (Brain Products GmbH, Gilching, Germany) with active Ag/AgCl electrodes mounted in the NinjaCap following the actiCAP arrangement. The sites normally occupied by FT9, FT10, T7, and T8 were repurposed to record horizontal and vertical EOG channels."

We then follow with the identification of bad channels and their interpolation using information from the remaining \"good\" channels, together with average rereferencing. Finally, we remove as much alpha motor activity from EEG data as possible so true sources do not interfere with our synthetically generated ones. To this end, we use the spatio-spectral decomposition (SSD) algorithm (Nikulin et al., 2011) to identify alpha-band neural oscillations and remove the components whose highest activity lay in the left-motor region."
