    "# MRI T1 Processing and Segmentation Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook outlines the workflow for MRI T1 processing and segmentation, specifically tailored for use within Cedalion. Cedalion workflows require either individual or standard head models, built from raw T1 images through a series of segmentation and brain surface extraction steps. This document details the complete processing pipeline for creating standard head models, facilitating the extension of these methods to individual head models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of the Processing Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow integrates multiple tools outside Python, including Brainstorm, CAT12, and FreeSurfer, for sequential processing of MRI data. This documentation provides a step-by-step guide to help ensure efficient data preparation, segmentation, and model alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: T1 Image Preprocessing with CAT12 in Brainstorm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Brainstorm Overview**:  \n",
    "   Brainstorm is an open-source application designed for the analysis of brain recordings. It can be used as a standalone version or installed via MATLAB, and is integral to many neuroimaging workflows. It makes it easy to perform CAT12 and Freesurfer analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **CAT12 Toolbox**:  \n",
    "   CAT12 is a computational toolbox within the SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping) environment, primarily used for structural MRI (sMRI) analysis. CAT12 automates many preprocessing steps required for sMRI, including:\n",
    "   - **Tissue segmentation** into six types (skull, scalp, cerebrospinal fluid [CSF], gray matter, white matter, and air).\n",
    "   - **Normalization and modulation** of images.\n",
    "   - **Surface generation** for brain and head models.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Output from CAT12**: For Cedalion, we use CAT12’s outputted 6-type tissue segmentations (skull, scalp, CSF, gray matter, white matter, and air) and the generated head surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Detailed Analysis with FreeSurfer\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FreeSurfer Overview**:  \n",
    "   FreeSurfer is a widely-used software package in neuroimaging, specifically for MRI structural analysis. Known for its precise and reproducible methods, FreeSurfer is used to segment brain structures, reconstruct cortical surfaces, and quantify cortical thickness, surface area, and volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Processing Outputs**:  \n",
    "   In this workflow, FreeSurfer provides details including:\n",
    "   - **Cortical and subcortical segmentation**\n",
    "   - **Gray and white matter segmentation**\n",
    "   - **Detailed brain surface model**\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Key Outputs from FreeSurfer**: Cedalion’s workflow uses FreeSurfer’s gray matter and white matter segmentations and its detailed brain surface model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Alignment and Optimization in Brainstorm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Alignment**:  \n",
    "   To ensure consistency, outputs from CAT12 and FreeSurfer are loaded into Brainstorm, where tissue segmentation files and surfaces are aligned to MNI coordinates. This step is crucial for integrating data accurately within Cedalion’s models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mesh Optimization**:  \n",
    "   Since FreeSurfer surfaces contain ~300K vertices, we downsample the mesh in Brainstorm to a more manageable 15K vertices, which balances detail and processing efficiency in Cedalion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Post-Processing of Tissue Segmentation Masks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Post-Processing Workflow**:  \n",
    "   To finalize tissue segmentation masks, Cedalion applies additional post-processing steps to smoothen boundaries and fill small gaps. These operations ensure cleaner and more continuous tissue delineation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Preservation of Key Segmentations**:\n",
    "   - **Gray and White Matter**: FreeSurfer’s gray and white matter segmentations are retained without modification due to their high accuracy. Final checks are applied to prevent overlap between masks and to ensure clarity in tissue delineation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "For each T1 image, the workflow yields the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **6 Tissue Segmentation Masks**: skull, scalp, CSF, gray matter, white matter, and air (air mask optional).\n",
    "- **Head Surface and Brain Surface** \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the brain surface, along with gray and white matter masks, originates from FreeSurfer. All other segmentation masks and the head surface are generated from CAT12.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flowchart below provides a visual summary of this processing pipeline.\n",
