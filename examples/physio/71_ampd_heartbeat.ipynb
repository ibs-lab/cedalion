    "# AMPD - Automatic Multiscale Peak Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an end-to-end pipeline for processing and analyzing fNIRS data collected during a finger-tapping task. The primary goal is to identify peaks in the time series data using an **Optimized AMPD** algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **AMPD** algorithm is a multiscale peak detection technique that is especially effective for periodic and quasi-periodic signals, such as heart beats, even in the presence of noise. By analyzing the signal at multiple scales, the algorithm can reliably detect local maxima while minimizing false positives. This method is based on the work by **[Scholkmann et al. 2012](https://doi.org/10.3390/a5040588)**\n",

    "### Optimized AMPD\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Optimized AMPD** uses vectorization and data segmentation for improved performance and resource management.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methodology:\n",
    "1. **Detrending**: Each channel and wavelength signal is first detrended to remove baseline shifts, making peaks easier to detect.\n",
    "2. **Local Scalogram Matrix (LSM)**: The detrended signal is processed in overlapping chunks. A matrix (LSM) is created to identify regions where local maxima occur across different scales.\n",
    "3. **Multi-Scale Analysis**: The algorithm analyzes how these maxima behave across scales, accumulating values into a vector \\( G \\), which helps identify the scale at which peaks are most pronounced.\n",
    "4. **Peak Identification**: Peaks are identified at locations where the local maxima are consistent across scales, as indicated by low standard deviation values in the LSM.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters:\n",
    "- **`amplitudes`**: An `xarray.DataArray` that contains amplitude data from fnirs signals\n",
    "- optional **`chunk_size`**: Controls the size of each overlapping segment processed. A larger size can capture more context but may increase computation time.\n",
    "- optional **`step_size`**: Determines the step increment for the overlapping chunks, controlling how much the segments overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "The output, `peaks_xr`, is an `xarray.DataArray` that mirrors the shape and structure of the input data (`amplitudes`). Each detected peak in `peaks_xr` is marked with a `1`, while non-peak values are marked as `0`. This format allows easy access to peak locations across different channels and wavelengths.\n"
