	abstract = {A novel (differential) entropy estimator is introduced where the maximum entropy bound is used to approximate the entropy given the observations, and is computed using a numerical procedure thus resulting in accurate estimates for the entropy. We show that such an estimator exists for a wide class of measuring functions, and provide a number of design examples to demonstrate its ﬂexible nature. We then derive a novel independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm that uses the entropy estimate thus obtained, ICA by entropy bound minimization (ICA-EBM). The algorithm adopts a line search procedure, and initially uses updates that constrain the demixing matrix to be orthogonal for robust performance. We demonstrate the superior performance of ICA-EBM and its ability to match sources that come from a wide range of distributions using simulated and real-world data.},

	abstract = {By assuming latent sources are statistically independent, independent component analysis separates underlying sources from a given linear mixture. Since in many applications, latent sources are both non-Gaussian and have sample dependence, it is desirable to exploit both properties jointly. In this paper, we use mutual information rate to construct a general framework for analysis and derivation of algorithms that take both properties into account. We discuss two types of source models for entropy rate estimation—a Markovian and an invertible ﬁlter model—and give the general independent component analysis cost function, update rule, and performance analysis based on these. We also introduce four algorithms based on these two models, and show that their performance can approach the Cramér-Rao lower bound. In addition, we demonstrate that the algorithms with ﬂexible models exhibit very desirable performance for “natural” data.},

abstract = {The primary goal of most cochlear implant procedures is to improve a patient's ability to discriminate speech. To accomplish this, cochlear implants are programmed so as to maximize speech understanding. However, programming a cochlear implant can be an iterative, labor-intensive process that takes place over months. In this study, we sought to determine whether functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a non-invasive neuroimaging method which is safe to use repeatedly and for extended periods of time, can provide an objective measure of whether a subject is hearing normal speech or distorted speech. We used a 140 channel fNIRS system to measure activation within the auditory cortex in 19 normal hearing subjects while they listed to speech with different levels of intelligibility. Custom software was developed to analyze the data and compute topographic maps from the measured changes in oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentration. Normal speech reliably evoked the strongest responses within the auditory cortex. Distorted speech produced less region-specific cortical activation. Environmental sounds were used as a control, and they produced the least cortical activation. These data collected using fNIRS are consistent with the fMRI literature and thus demonstrate the feasibility of using this technique to objectively detect differences in cortical responses to speech of different intelligibility.}

	abstract = {Recent functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) instrumentation encompasses several dozen of optodes to enable reconstructing a hemodynamic image of the entire cerebral cortex. Despite its potential clinical applicability, widespread use of fNIRS with human subjects is currently limited by unresolved issues, namely the collection from the entirety of optical channels of signals with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) sufficient to carry out a reliable estimation of cortical hemodynamics, and the considerable amount of time that placing numerous optodes take with individuals for whom achieving good optical coupling to the scalp is difficult due to thick or dark hair. To address these issues, we developed a numerical method that: 1) at the channel level, computes an objective measure of the signalto-noise ratio (SNR) related to its optical coupling to the scalp, akin to electrode conductivity used in electroencephalography (EEG), and 2) at the optode level, determines and displays the coupling status of all individual optodes in real time on a model of a human head. This approach aims to shorten the pre-acquisition preparation time by visually displaying which optodes require further adjustment for optimum scalp coupling, and to maximize the signalto-noise ratio (SNR) of all optical channels contributing to the functional hemodynamic mapping. The methodology described in this paper has been implemented in a software tool named PHOEBE (placing headgear optodes efficiently before experimentation) that is freely available for use by the fNIRS community.},

abstract = {Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive neuroimaging tool for studying evoked hemodynamic changes within the brain. By this technique, changes in the optical absorption of light are recorded over time and are used to estimate the functionally evoked changes in cerebral oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations that result from local cerebral vascular and oxygen metabolic effects during brain activity. Over the past three decades this technology has continued to grow, and today NIRS studies have found many niche applications in the fields of psychology, physiology, and cerebral pathology. The growing popularity of this technique is in part associated with a lower cost and increased portability of NIRS equipment when compared with other imaging modalities, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography. With this increasing number of applications, new techniques for the processing, analysis, and interpretation of NIRS data are continually being developed. We review some of the time-series and functional analysis techniques that are currently used in NIRS studies, we describe the practical implementation of various signal processing techniques for removing physiological, instrumental, and motion-artifact noise from optical data, and we discuss the unique aspects of NIRS analysis in comparison with other brain imaging modalities. These methods are described within the context of the MATLAB-based graphical user interface program, HomER, which we have developed and distributed to facilitate the processing of optical functional brain data.},

Method: The proposed system is based on the extended International 10–20 system which contains 74 electrodes, and extends this system up to 345 electrode locations. Results: The positioning and nomenclature of the electrode system is described, and a subset of locations is proposed as especially useful for modern EEG/ERP systems, often having 128 channels available. Conclusion: Similar to the extension of the 10–20 system to the 10–10 system (‘10% system’), proposed in 1985, the goal of this new extension to a 10–5 system is to further promote standardization in high-resolution EEG studies.}

abstract={<p>Surface visualizations of fMRI provide a comprehensive view of cortical activity. However, surface visualizations are difficult to generate and most common visualization techniques rely on unnecessary interpolation which limits the fidelity of the resulting maps. Furthermore, it is difficult to understand the relationship between flattened cortical surfaces and the underlying 3D anatomy using tools available currently. To address these problems we have developed pycortex, a Python toolbox for interactive surface mapping and visualization. Pycortex exploits the power of modern graphics cards to sample volumetric data on a per-pixel basis, allowing dense and accurate mapping of the voxel grid across the surface. Anatomical and functional information can be projected onto the cortical surface. The surface can be inflated and flattened interactively, aiding interpretation of the correspondence between the anatomical surface and the flattened cortical sheet. The output of pycortex can be viewed using WebGL, a technology compatible with modern web browsers. This allows complex fMRI surface maps to be distributed broadly online without requiring installation of complex software.</p>}}
