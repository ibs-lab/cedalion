# Contributors

This section is WIP. You will find more information and detailed stats here soon. 

Cedalion is an open source project driven by the [IBS-Lab](https://ibs-lab.com/) with the aim to encourage continuous use, contribution and improvement from the whole community to make it last. Therefore, code credit is important to us.


## Code Credit
Here you will find a list of code contributors soon. Until then, please see:
https://github.com/ibs-lab/cedalion/graphs/contributors

## Scientific Credit
This documentation contains a dedicated [section that lets you search and find references to scientific papers](https://doc.ibs.tu-berlin.de/cedalion/doc/dev/references.html
). Papers that introduce methods implemented in Cedalion show up here. If you contribute code to the toolbox that is based on a scientific method, please add the bibtex entries to our references.bib file and mention the paper in the function's docstring to give its inventors the visibility they deserve. 

## Special Mentions
- Special thanks to members of the Bio Optical & Acoustic Spectroscopy (BOAS) Lab at Boston University's Neurophotonics Center: Laura Carlton, Sung Ahn, Meryem YÃ¼cel and David Boas. 
- Thanks to Jiaming Cao from the University of Birmingham for actively supporting us in the adoption of [NIRFASTer](https://github.com/nirfaster/NIRFASTer) into cedailion.
