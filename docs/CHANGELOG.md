- Fixed a bug in motion_correct_wavelet affecting the selection of coefficients for IQR-based thresholding. The issue caused unintended suppression of high-frequency components, particularly near the end of recordings. Changed by [Eike Middell](https://github.com/emiddell).


## Version 25.1.0 (2025-06-22)

All dependencies have been updated to recent versions. Please rebuild the environment.
